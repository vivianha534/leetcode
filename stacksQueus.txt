 stack (LIFO)
    This is like a dynamic array
    searching for an arbitrary value in the stack would take linear time
    insertion - push
    deletion - pop
 Queues (FIFO)
    This is like a linked list
    insertion - enqueue
    deletion - dequeue
 Stacks and Queues have constant time (and space) insertion and deletion
